# Feature: Security Vulnerability Detection

## Description

This feature will focus on detecting common security vulnerabilities in C# code. It will use a combination of static analysis techniques, including data flow analysis and pattern matching, to identify potential security risks.

The following security vulnerabilities will be detected:

- **SQL Injection:** Detects cases where user input is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Detects cases where user input is rendered in a web page without proper encoding.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** Detects the use of insecure deserialization methods that can lead to remote code execution.
- **Hardcoded Secrets:** Detects hardcoded passwords, API keys, and other secrets in the source code.
- **Use of Insecure Cryptographic Algorithms:** Detects the use of weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms.

## Requirements

- **OWASP Top 10:** The analyzer should cover the most common security vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the OWASP Top 10.
- **CWE Compatibility:** The detected vulnerabilities should be mapped to the corresponding Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries.
- **Low False Positives:** The analyzer should have a low rate of false positives to avoid overwhelming developers with security warnings.
- **Integration with Security Tools:** The analyzer should be able to export its findings in a format that can be imported by other security tools (e.g., SARIF).

## Limitations

- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** The analyzer will not be able to detect new or unknown security vulnerabilities.
- **Business Logic Flaws:** The analyzer will not be able to detect security vulnerabilities that are caused by flaws in the business logic of the application.

## Dependencies

- **Data Flow Analysis:** This feature depends on the data flow analysis feature to track the flow of data and identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS.

## User Stories

- As a security professional, I want to scan our codebase for security vulnerabilities to identify and prioritize risks.
- As a developer, I want to get real-time feedback on security vulnerabilities in my code so that I can fix them before they are committed.
- As a compliance officer, I want to generate reports on the security posture of our applications to demonstrate compliance with security standards.
