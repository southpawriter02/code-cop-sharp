# code-cop-sharp
A custom Roslyn-based code analyzer to enforce specific coding standards or identify common anti-patterns in C# projects. It would integrate directly into Visual Studio (showing squiggles) and the `dotnet build` process, providing compile-time feedback to developers. This is a great way to maintain code quality and consistency across a team.
