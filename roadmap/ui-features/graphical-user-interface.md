# Feature: Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Description

This feature will provide a standalone graphical user interface (GUI) for the C# code analyzer. The GUI will allow users to run the code analysis, view the results, and configure the settings in a user-friendly way.

The GUI will provide the following features:

- **Project Explorer:** A project explorer that allows users to browse and select the files and folders to be analyzed.
- **Analysis Results Viewer:** A viewer that displays the code analysis results in a clear and organized way.
- **Rule Configuration Editor:** An editor that allows users to configure the code analysis rules and settings.
- **Dashboard:** A dashboard that provides a high-level overview of the code quality of the analyzed projects.

## Requirements

- **Cross-Platform:** The GUI should be cross-platform and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **User-Friendly:** The GUI should be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.
- **Responsive:** The GUI should be responsive and provide a smooth user experience.
- **Integration with IDEs:** The GUI should be able to launch the IDE and navigate to the location of a detected issue.

## Limitations

- **Standalone Application:** The GUI will be a standalone application and will not be integrated into an IDE. Users who prefer IDE integration should use the IDE extensions.
- **Feature Set:** The GUI may not have all the features of the IDE integration, such as real-time analysis and quick fixes.

## Dependencies

- **Static Code Analysis:** This feature depends on the static code analysis feature to run the code analysis.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** This feature depends on the reporting and visualization feature to display the analysis results.

## User Stories
